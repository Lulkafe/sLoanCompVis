# Visualization of Student loan complaints
This is a visualisation based on “Consumer Complaint Database” from [a CFPB (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) webpage](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/) and its “Student Loan” section.
sloanComp.csv is a preprocessed file made of the database. More detail will be available on my website.

The live demo is available [here](https://bl.ocks.org/Lulkafe/54219f02b4e1624d664b0913550da143).
